<!--
    -Webpack help us in oragnizing JS
    at the end it generates a single JS file
    -Webpack is a module bundler
    -at the end one file i.e bundle.js is generated and put into public folder
-->

<!--
    Using global npm modules is not a good project
    because all dependencies are not tracked in package.json
    because we may have multiple projects then they have to use the same setting
