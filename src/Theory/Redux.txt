- Redux is also used to manage state of application similar to normal 'component react state'.
- With states in case of complex scenarios its very diificult to manage, redux makes it easy
- 'component react state' states are good when we have simple structure i.e single tree where we can pass data in form of 
props to the children.
- But in case of complex projects we have multiple trees and using normal states becomes very difficult
so we use redux.

- 1st Advantage: In simpler terms redux helps in managing complex states in applications.
- 2nd advantage: of redux is it helps in making reusable components i.e loosely coupled components.

Redux is a state container.
We use redux store for managing states where in we can add data to state or read data from the state.
Redux stores data in form of object only.
